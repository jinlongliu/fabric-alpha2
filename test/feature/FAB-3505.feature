Feature: FAB-3505 Test chaincode_example02
    As a user I want to run chaincode example02

Scenario Outline: Test chaincode example02 deploy
  Given I have a bootstrapped fabric network of type <type>
  When a user deploys chaincode at path "github.com/hyperledger/fabric/chaincode_example02" with ["init", "a", "1000" , "b", "2000"] with name "mycc"
  Then the chaincode is deployed
  When a user queries on the chaincode named "mycc" with args ["query", "a"]
  Then a user receives expected response is 1000
  When a user invokes on the chaincode named "mycc" with args ["txId1", "invoke", "a", 10]
  When a user queries on the chaincode named "mycc" with args ["query", "a"]
  Then a user receives expected response is 990

  Given "Peer1" is taken down
  When a user invokes on the chaincode named "mycc" with args ["txId1", "invoke", "a", 10]
  And I wait "15" seconds
  And "Peer1" comes back up
  When a user queries on the chaincode named "mycc" with args ["query", "a"] on "Peer1"
  Then a user receives expected response is 980


  Examples:
    | type  |
    | solo  |
    | kafka |
